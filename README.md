E-commerce Website Design Project

This repository contains the code for a responsive e-commerce website design  for a online sports store built with HTML and CSS.

Project Overview

This project aims to create a modern and user-friendly e-commerce website homepage. The design includes the following sections:

1. Banner section
2. Featured category images
3. Featured products with price, image, and rating
4. Latest products section
5. Offer section with exclusive product
6. Testimonials section
7. Top brands section
8. Responsive footer with 4 columns
   
The website will be fully responsive, meaning it will adapt its layout to various screen sizes, particularly for mobile devices with a dedicated dropdown menu.

Note: This project focuses solely on the design aspect. Functionality like product pages, shopping cart, login, and registration will not be implemented here.
